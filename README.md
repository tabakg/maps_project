# Maps

The idea behind this project is to show maps differently. Instead of distances
reflecting the physical distances between pairs of points, distances instead will
reflect some other quantity, like the minimum amount of time it takes to travel
between two points.

To do this, we use ISOMAP and embed the points in the first two coordinates
found.
